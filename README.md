# Magic-the-gathering

Magic was the first massive trading card game, starting in 1993 it has approximately twenty million players as of 2015, and over twenty billion Magic cards produced in the period from 2008 to 2016, during which time it grew in popularity. 

You get cards by buying decks of cards that have certain sets of cards in it. Some cards are rare to get, some are more powerfull in turnements, therefore cards have different prices that you can find in https://www.cardmarket.com/en/Magic. 

TO DO: "Study money exchange between magic cards since cardmarket is there" 

The objective of this repo is to give an introduction to time series analysis and modelling by creating a model that predicts the price of a card x days in advance. 

"Roadmap of ideas":
Other challenges that come in the way:
 - Web scrapping (to get the data from different websites) 
 - Data cleaning (to standardize the data into processing ready format)
 - Merging data bases
 - Feature engineering (to give relevant features to our model) 
  - Feature extraction with NLP methods 
  - Feature extraction with time series methods 
  - Feature extraction on real events 
 - Modelling methods (How to choose the right model) 
 - Validation methods (How to validate your results) 
 
 Other possible ideas: 
 - Use Adam's server to run our model live and have alerts on prices that should spike live!! And make money out of it maybe 
   - Introduction to bring a model into QA and into production 
   - What does it mean to have a model live? How do you keep it working
   - Introduction to live monitoring of a model 
   - Introduction to retraining pipelines with tensorflowExtended
